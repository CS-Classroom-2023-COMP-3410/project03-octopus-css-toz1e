This project was not super hard but some aspects still played as a challenge. A major struggle I faced was to determine the structure of the website based on a screenshot because the screenshot the website was not full screen which made it hard to estimate the sizing and spacing for all the different aspects. It was also a challenge to have the screenshot up while editing the code and also have my website on chrome as well. It would have been a lot easier if I had 2 monitors but I found myself resorting to using my phone with the screenshot then running split screen to see how my changes were effecting the website. I was not the biggest fan of this project but I think it was benefical to my understanding of Css and throughout the project I did learn a few new tools and figured out some of the coding langauges to change aspects that I didn't orginally know I could do. Overall the project was not the most difficult but did take a good chunk of time to match the website to the best of my ability. But again that may not be fully represented unless you have the page at a certain size(which was a major issue throughout the css writing becaues I wanted to use relative sizing for things using the % size but often found myself using direct sizing to better match the screenshot).
